# 🌾 Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to help farmers and agricultural experts make informed decisions about the crop yield based on various environmental parameters. By leveraging a Machine Learning model, it will predict how much crop will grow in that particular season based on user input such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil nutrients (NPK values).
